This CodeBook file lists the data transformations performed as part of the run_analysis script. Detailed information on the project is available in the Readme.

The script generates two outputs, data frames "merged_data2" and "merged_data3".

Both data frames contain 82 columns that are listed as follows. "merged_data3" is the summarized version of "merged_data2" where the original data frame was summarized based on grouping variables "ActivityID", "SubjectID" and "ActivityName" while the mean of all other valuables was calculated.

The original data contained two data sets, "train" and "test". Based on the assignment insctruction, "train" and "test" data files were merged using a "cbind" function, creating new data sets that contain all "train" and "test" rows. 
Column 1 "ActivityID" is the data.frame represantation of "y_train/test", a list containing all activity information. 
Column 2 "SubjectID" is the data.frame representation of "subject_train/test", a list containing all subject information. 
Using reference table "activity_labels", Column 82 "ActivityName" was added to the data set based on the keys "ActivityID" in both datasets.
Based on the instructions, only the mean and std values were to be extracted from the dataset containing all measurmenet data ("X_test/train"), therefore we have pre-selected the column numbers for variables that contain either "mean" or "std" in the key table " "features" and used these column numbers to extract only the required columns. Measurement columns were added to the data set via "rbind", creating columns 3-81. Column names were also added based on the "features" data.
